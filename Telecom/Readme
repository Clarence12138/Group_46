Codes from telecom
There are two part on our car, so we provide the code on Arduino Mega 2560 and the code on ESP32-CAM.

The code on Arduino Mega 2560 control how the car move in the maze. It shows how we link three ultrasonic sensors and two motors.
It also shows how we use them to let the car find its way in the maze.

The code on ESP32-CAM control the creation of wifi and the video.
It displays the wifi name and connection method that we have set, as well as showing our data transmission channel.

The way to use the car is set the code "CarMovingFinal" on Arduino Mega 2560 and link the power. The camera will run automatically so put the car in maze is the last step.
